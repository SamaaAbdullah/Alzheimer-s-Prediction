# Alzheimer-s-Prediction
A machine learning model 

# Project Description
Alzheimerâ€™s disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills. This project builds a machine learning model to predict the severity of Alzheimerâ€™s disease based on patient data, including MRI measurements and cognitive test results. The model is trained using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and classification algorithms.
