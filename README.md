# Alzheimer-s-Prediction
A machine learning model designed to predict the severity of Alzheimerâ€™s disease

# Project Description
Alzheimerâ€™s disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills. This project builds a machine learning model to predict the severity of Alzheimerâ€™s disease based on patient data, including MRI measurements and cognitive test results. The model is trained using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and classification algorithms.

# Dataset
Source: Alzheimerâ€™s Prediction Dataset - Global (Kaggle)
Size: (Rows: 74,283 & Columns: 25)
Features: Includes cognitive test scores, MRI scan data, age, gender, and other medical attributes.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Preprocessing (Encoding, Missing Values, Correlation Analysis)  
- Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, v)  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
